# Shared station policy

This canonical constraint document declares host-owned station limits and mode
interlocks for one shared pump.

```ghost
constraints StationRules {
  exclusive(automatic, manual, configuring);

  allow enter(Auto, Manual, Configure)
    only when mode == Stopped && stopped(station);
  allow apply(settings)
    only when mode == Configure && stopped(station);

  require count_on(pump1.valves) <= 2;
  require pump1.on => any_on(pump1.valves);
  limit on_time(pump1) <= 1h per day("Asia/Seoul");
  once starts per occurrence;
  check pump_capacity(pump1);
}
```
